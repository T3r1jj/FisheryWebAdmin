FisheryWebAdmin is a web app written in Java that provides user interface for admin access to Fishery project services. The app is based on Spring Boot + AngularJS + Material Design.

The admin interface gives access to CRUD web service and allows to integrate-and-edit some data from KnowledgeBase. Remaining integration (like weather and fish existence check which can be fully automated) is done by other modules.   

The project achieved a stable version 1.0.0.
