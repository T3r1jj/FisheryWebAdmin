# ![FisheryWebAdmin](src/main/resources/static/assets/favicon-32x32.png) FisheryWebAdmin 

FisheryWebAdmin is a web application written in **Java and JavaScript** (+HTML, CSS, LESS) that provides user interface for admin access to the **distributed** Fishery project services. The app is based on **Spring Boot + AngularJS + Material Design**.

The admin interface gives access to CRUD web service and allows to integrate-and-edit some data gathered from KnowledgeBase. The connection with the client module provides user management (reservations, e-mailing). It also displays status of the user apps.   

FisheryWebAdmin was hosted at Heroku. It requires distributed CRUD, KnowledgeBase and client modules to be up and running to provide full functionality.
